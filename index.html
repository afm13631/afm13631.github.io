<p>Manchester United is known to have big named, world-class players throughout its history like Cristiano Ronaldo, a few years back, and some who are currently on the squad now including Paul Pogba.</p>
<p>Some legendary players include:
<ul>
	<li>George Best</li>
	<li>Sir Bobby Charlton</li>
	<li>Eric Cantona</li>
	<li>Roy Keane</li>
</ul></p>
<p>During the long season, 3 points are awarded for a win, 1 point for a draw and 0 points for a loss. The club with the most
points at the end of the season is crowned English Premier League Champions. As the current season is coming to an end, United sits in 5th place but only 2 points 
behind Chelsea who is in 4th place. The top 4 teams qualify for The Champions League. The Champions League takes all of the top teams from Europe and puts them all in 
a massive tournament to see who the best in the world is.

<p>Manchester United has failed to win since the 2012-13 season but this drought could soon end with the new hiring of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer as the head 
coach. Ole is a former United player so he knows what it takes to win championships.</p>
